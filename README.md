# crop-prediction-using-python
 
 
This project is all about predicting the which crops to plant after studing the different prameters like npk values of soil, surrounding temperature, types of soil, current season, pH value of soil and and humidity of the environment. 
During the development of this project different research were done for the collection of data like some of the data were downloaded from internet from open sources and some are added(soil_types and suitable season to grow the respective crops),preprocessing it to get the suitable format for calcultions.
Different approaches(Naive Bayes, Logistic regression, Support vector machine K nearest neighbors, RandomForest and Decision Tree) were tried for the development of model.Among all these approaches Decision tree approach was able to obtain the highest accuracy score, and was finalize for this approach for the model.
