# crop-prediction-using-python
 
 
This project is all about predicting which crops to plant after studying the different parameters like npk values of soil, surrounding temperature, types of soil, current season, pH value of soil and humidity of the environment. 
During the development of this project different researches were done for the collection of data like some of the data were downloaded from the internet from open sources and some are added(soil_types and suitable season to grow the respective crops),preprocessing it to get the suitable format for calculations. 
Different approaches(Naive Bayes, Logistic regression, Support vector machine K nearest neighbors, RandomForest and Decision Tree) were tried for the development of model.Among all these approaches Decision tree was able to obtain the highest accuracy score, and was finalize for the model.
